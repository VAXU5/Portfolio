        <h2>Portfolio</h2>
        <p>Hey, my name is Lion Shabani! I am currently 14 years old and striving for a career path towards computer science. </p><br><br>
        <p>My favourite activities are: listening to podcasts, programming, learning and reading and writing books, because when I do these thinks, I feel like its just me and the activity and no other people and interuptions.</p><br>
        <p>I also want to help other people because programming is nothing more than problem solving.</p><br>
        <p>I always wanted to get a computer to play video games with it in better quality and frame rate, but as soon as I got a 5 hours Python tutorial recommended, many things changed!</p><br>
        <p>I didn't start programming for anything else but for fun and now im trying to get a job in that direction, life often turns and breaks.</p><br><br>
        <p>If you're intrested in some projects of mine, please view them by going on my github!<p><br>
        <p>Anyways, thank you for visiting this website ‚ù§</p>
